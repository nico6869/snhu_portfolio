### Software Design Document 📋
**Summary:** The gaming room is a company looking to expand the reach of there already successful game *Draw It or Lose It*. They wanted their product to reach many more platforms including IOS and Android.

**Things done well:** I belive that for the first software design document it went well. I believe I would gone more in depth, and taken time to research the problem and possible solutions more.

**What did the design document help with:** Having a design document helps define what the optimal outcomes of the project are, as well as look at limitations. When you are focused on solving the problems of the code at a *macro* level, it can make it hard to see the bigger picture. It is important to keep the bigger picture in mind when creating solutions. In the end you are writing code for the end users and the shareholders of the software.

**What would I revise:** I would go back over the design System Architecture view, and the requirements and better complete those parts.

**My interpretation of the users needs:** I interpreted the needs of the user to be a cost effective solution to develop, deploy and maintain the project code.

**My approach:** I took the approach of factoring in the limitations of the software, and figuring out where it could be deployed to find the best solution for reachability, and compatibility. If I were to go back again, I would like to understand some of the cloud based solutions better, and maybe look that the pricing closer.
